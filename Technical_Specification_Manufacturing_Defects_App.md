# Technical Specification: Manufacturing Defects Data Analysis App

## Project Overview
A React-based data analysis showcase application displaying manufacturing defects data with interactive visualizations, detailed analysis, and professional presentation. The app will be hosted on GitHub Pages to demonstrate data analysis skills.

## Tech Stack Recommendation
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (faster than Create React App)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI (modern, responsive)
- **Charts**: Recharts (React-native, performant)
- **Data Table**: TanStack Table (formerly React Table)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn

## Data Description
The dataset contains 1,002 records of manufacturing defects with the following columns:
- defect_id: Unique identifier for each defect
- product_id: Identifier for the product associated with the defect
- defect_type: Type or category of the defect (e.g., cosmetic, functional, structural)
- defect_description: Description of the defect
- defect_date: Date when the defect was detected
- defect_location: Location within the product where the defect was found
- severity: Severity level of the defect (minor, moderate, critical)
- inspection_method: Method used to detect the defect
- repair_action: Action taken to repair or address the defect
- repair_cost: Cost incurred to repair the defect (in local currency)
